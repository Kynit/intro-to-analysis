\begin{solution} 
(Greg)

From Axiom 1, there are three cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$p = 0$

$p$ is equal to the only element of $M$. 
From the definition of limit point, every segment containing $p$ must contain a point of $M$ different from $p$. 
However, there are no points in $M$ different from $p$, so $p$ must not be a limit point of $M$.

\item
$p > 0$

From Axiom 3, there exists a point $a$ such that $0 < a < p$. 
There also exists a point $b$ such that $b > p$. 
Since $p > 0$ and $b > p$, Axiom 2 tells us that $b > 0$. 
We can then form the segment $S = (a, b)$. 
Since $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, $0$ is not between $a$ and $b$, so $S$ does not contain $0$. 
However, $a < p < b$, so $S$ contains $p$. 
$S$ is a segment containing $p$ that does not contain any element of $M$, so $p$ is not a limit point of $M$.

\item
$p < 0$

(symmetric to the $p > 0$ case)
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, regardless of our choice of $p$, we can construct a segment that contradicts the requirements in the limit point definition, so $p$ is not a limit point of $M$.
\end{solution}

According to Definition 4, we can prove that $p$ is not a limit point of $M$ if we can construct a segment containing $p$ but not a different point of $M$.
Construct this segment as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
If all points of $M$ are on the opposite side of $p$, choose any value as an endpoint.

\item
If any point of $M$ is on the same side of $p$, choose a point between the nearest point of $M$ and $p$.
(Axiom 3 confirms that there will be such a point.)
\end{enumerate}

This segment contains $p$ but will not contain any points of $M$ (with the exception of $p$, if $p$ is $0$ or $1$).
Therefore, we have found a segment that does not fulfill the requirements of Definition 4, so $p$ is not a limit point of $M$.
